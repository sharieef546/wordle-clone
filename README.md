# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Briefing Document: Wordle Clone Analysis & Feature Enhancement

1. Overview

This document analyzes the provided React code for a Wordle game clone. The code is well-structured, utilizing components and custom hooks to manage game state and logic. It covers core Wordle functionality like guessing words, providing feedback on letter positions, and managing game over conditions. The app fetches possible solutions and letters from a db.json file using localhost:3001.

2. Main Themes and Important Ideas

Component-Based Architecture: The application is built using React components for each major UI element:
App.js: The main application component that manages the game's solution and renders the Wordle component.
Wordle.js: Handles the core game logic using the useWordle hook and renders the Grid, Keypad, and Modal components.
Grid.js: Displays the grid of letter guesses.
Row.js: Represents a single row in the grid, displaying the letters and their colors.
Keypad.js: Represents the interactive keypad for letter input, highlighting used keys.
Modal.js: Displays the win/loss modal with the solution and number of guesses.
Custom Hook (useWordle.js): This hook encapsulates all the game logic, making the Wordle component cleaner and more focused on rendering the UI. It manages:
turn: The current turn number.
currentGuess: The player's current word being typed.
guesses: An array of previous guesses (each guess is an array of letter objects).
history: An array of strings representing previous guesses, used to prevent duplicates.
isCorrect: A boolean indicating whether the player has guessed the solution.
usedKeys: An object storing the color feedback for each letter on the keypad (e.g., {a: 'grey', b: 'green'}).
handleKeyup: The function that processes keyboard input.
State Management: The code relies heavily on React's useState hook to manage the game's state. This state is passed down as props to child components, triggering re-renders when the state changes.
Game Logic: The useWordle hook implements the core game logic:
formatGuess(): Analyzes the current guess against the solution and assigns colors (green, yellow, grey) to each letter.
addNewGuess(): Adds the formatted guess to the guesses array, updates the history, increments the turn, and updates usedKeys.
handleKeyup(): Handles keyboard input, validating guesses (length, duplicates, character type), and calling formatGuess and addNewGuess.
Data Fetching: The application fetches the list of possible solutions and the letters for the keypad from a db.json file using fetch. This allows for easy modification of the words and letters without changing the code.
CSS Animations: The index.css file contains CSS animations (flip and bounce) that enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback on letter guesses and input.
3. Key Quotes

From useWordle.js:"if (solutionArray.includes(l.key) && l.color !== 'green') { formattedGuess[i].color = 'yellow' solutionArray[solutionArray.indexOf(l.key)] = null }" – This shows the logic for identifying "yellow" letters (present in the solution but in the wrong position).
"if (currentGuess === solution) { setIsCorrect(true) }" – This simple conditional sets isCorrect to true if the player guesses correctly.
From Modal.js:"You Win! You found the solution in {turn} guesses :)" – This is a straightforward message displayed in the modal when the player wins.
From App.js:"const randomSolution = json[Math.floor(Math.random()*json.length)] setSolution(randomSolution.word)" - This generates a random solution word based on the data in the solutions array.
4. Project Structure

db.json: Contains the letters array (for the keypad) and the solutions array (possible Wordle answers).
src/: The main source code directory.
components/: Contains the React components: Grid.js, Keypad.js, Modal.js, Row.js, Wordle.js.
hooks/: Contains the custom hook useWordle.js.
App.js: The main application component.
index.js: The entry point for the React application, rendering the App component.
index.css: The main CSS file for styling the application.
5. Suggestions for Unique Features and Improvements

Here are some ideas to make your Wordle clone stand out:

Hard Mode:Implement a "Hard Mode" setting. In Hard Mode:
Any revealed hints (green or yellow letters) must be used in subsequent guesses in the same positions or at all.
This can be achieved in useWordle.js by adding a check within handleKeyup or addNewGuess to ensure the current guess adheres to the existing hints. You'll need to store the known green and yellow letter positions/values.
Themed Keyboards:Allow users to select different keyboard themes (e.g., dark mode, high contrast, custom color schemes).
Store the theme preference in local storage and apply the appropriate CSS classes to the keypad elements.
Statistics Tracking:Track user statistics such as:
Games played
Win percentage
Current streak
Longest streak
Guess distribution (how many games won in 1 guess, 2 guesses, etc.)
Store these statistics in local storage using localStorage.setItem and localStorage.getItem. Update the stats after each game in the Modal component.
Word Definition/Pronunciation:When the game is over (win or lose), display the definition and/or pronunciation of the solution word.
Integrate with a dictionary API (e.g., Merriam-Webster, DictionaryAPI) to fetch the definition.
Display the definition in the Modal component.
Custom Word Lists:Allow users to create and use their own custom word lists. This could involve:
A form to enter words.
Storing the custom word list in local storage or a database.
An option to select the word list to use for the game.
Modify App.js to fetch the solution from the selected custom word list instead of the default solutions array.
Challenges:Implement daily or weekly challenges with specific word lists or constraints (e.g., "only words with double letters").
This can be done by pre-selecting the solution word based on the challenge.
Shareable Results:Allow users to share their game results (e.g., a grid of colored squares representing their guesses) on social media.
Use a library like html-to-image or dom-to-image to capture the Grid component as an image, then allow the user to download or share the image.
Multiplayer Mode (Advanced):Implement a real-time multiplayer mode where players compete to guess the word first.
This would require a backend server and technologies like WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) to handle real-time communication between players.
Hints:add hints when the user clicks the hint button
reduce some scores or turns if user use hints
Different Word Lengths: * allow the user to pick the word length for harder play
6. Step-by-Step Explanation of Project Build

Here's a breakdown of how you'd typically build this project from scratch:

Set Up the Project:Create a new React project using create-react-app:
npx create-react-app my-wordle
cd my-wordle
Install any necessary dependencies (e.g., html-to-image if you're implementing shareable results):
npm install html-to-image
Create the db.json File:Create a db.json file in the root directory of your project.
Populate it with the letters and solutions arrays as provided in the original code.
Implement the Components:Create the component files (Grid.js, Row.js, Keypad.js, Modal.js, Wordle.js).
Start by creating the basic structure and rendering of each component. Use placeholder data initially.
Implement the useWordle Hook:Create the useWordle.js file in the hooks/ directory.
Implement the state variables (turn, currentGuess, guesses, etc.).
Implement the formatGuess, addNewGuess, and handleKeyup functions.
Make sure the functions update the respective states.
Connect Components and Hook:In Wordle.js, import and use the useWordle hook, passing the solution as an argument.
Pass the state values and the handleKeyup function as props to the Grid and Keypad components.
Connect the components to the data fetched from the db.json file.
Implement Data Fetching in App.js:Use the useEffect hook to fetch the solutions data from db.json when the component mounts.
Set the solution state with a randomly selected word from the fetched data.
Implement CSS Styling:Create the index.css file and add the necessary styles for the components and animations.
Use CSS classes to control the appearance of the letters based on their feedback (green, yellow, grey).
Implement Game Over Logic:In the useEffect hook in Wordle.js, check for the win condition (isCorrect) and the loss condition (turn > 5).
Set the showModal state to true when either condition is met, and disable the keyup listener (window.removeEventListener).
Implement the Modal:Create the Modal.js component to display the win/loss message and the solution word.
Conditionally render the modal in Wordle.js based on the showModal state.
Test Thoroughly:Test the game thoroughly to ensure that all the logic is working correctly.
Check for edge cases and potential bugs.
7. Technical Considerations

API Endpoints (if using a separate backend): If you decide to use a backend server (e.g., Node.js with Express) to serve the word list, define the API endpoints for fetching the data (e.g., /solutions, /letters).
State Management Libraries (for larger applications): For larger applications, consider using state management libraries like Redux or Zustand to manage the global application state more efficiently.
Deployment: You can deploy your React application to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting.
By following these steps and incorporating some of the suggested unique features, you can create a compelling and distinctive Wordle clone. Good luck!
